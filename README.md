# Employee_Dashboard
### In this project I used MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI. In order to get full visibility about the company's headcount when it comes to current employees and to answer the following questions:
#### 1. What is the breakdown of active employees in the company?
#### 2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of the active employees in the company?
#### 3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
#### 4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
#### 5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
#### 6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
#### 7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
#### 8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
#### 9. What is the distribution of employees across location state by state?
#### 10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
#### 11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?
